# UltimateZones World Configuration
# Hint: Using -1 in any option inside this file let the Plugin ignore the restriction
# To allow creation the players needs also the correct permission to add zones inside of this world
# For further informations read the Github Page over World Configuration

# Allows to completly deactivate zones per world. All existing Zones in this world will be ignored
# until this is set to true. No new Zones can be created
# To deactivate the creation of Zones only for certain Users/Groups use the Permissions
# Warning: This pretends the plugin from load/init existing zones. They still exist in the database
activate-zones: true

# The following options define the maximum sizes of zones for players without the ignorerestrictions permission
# 'sts-multiplier' defines the maximum difference between two sides (disallows zones with sizes like 2 x 150)
# Hint: This Settings only counts for Main Zones!
